# JWST-HzRGs
This is a repository to simulate synthetic spectra for high-redshift radio galaxies, and convolve with available JWST NIRCam and NIRSpec filters to calculate apparent magnitudes, emission line strengths and ratios.

This code uses Bagpipes (Carnal+2018) to simulate synthetic spectra, and adds AGN emission produced through Cloudy to produce a final radio galaxy SED.
